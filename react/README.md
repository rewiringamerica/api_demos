# REM React Demo

This demonstration illustrates how to use [react](https://react.dev/) to call 
Rewiring America's Residential Electrification(REM) API. It constructs a web page
that allows users to type in their address and current heating fuel and get an
estimate of how much they could save by switching to a heat pump.

To the user, the final result looks a lot like our [HTML/JavaScript demo](../www).
The only difference is that this version is written in react.

If you are not already familiar with react, we suggest you have a look
at the [Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe),
which is a great interactive introduction to react.
