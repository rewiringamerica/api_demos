# WWW Demo (HTML/JavaScript)

This demo illustrates how to call the API from JavaScript on a simple web page. It shows how the 
API could be used to allow a web site visitor to enter their address and see how much
they could save by installing a heat pump.

The goal is to provide a simple wireframe-level working example as a starting point to illustrate how the
Rewiring America REM API can be intergrated into a web page.

The files are:

- [`index-old.html`](./index-old.html): A wireframe web site as it might have existed before
  the REM API was integrated.
- [`index.html`](./index.html): The main HTML file with a form and embedded JavaScript to
  make the API call and display the results.
- [`css/demo.css'](./css/demo.css): A CSS file that provides the wireframe look and feel for the
  demo HTML pages.
