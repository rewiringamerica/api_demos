# Client Libary Demos (Python/Typescript)

This demo includes example scripts demonstrating how to call the REM API using our Python and Typescript client library packages. Both scripts output an estimate of how much money a user could save on average annually by making an electrification upgrade.

You can read the corresponding blog post for these demos [here](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/tools/REM-API-client-library-code-access).

### Python client library

To install the REM API Python package, run:

```sh
pip install rewiringamerica-rem
```

Update `INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` and `INSERT_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE` with your own values. If needed, you can sign up for an API key [here](https://rewiring.link/api-signup).

Then, to execute the example script, `rem.py`, run:

```sh
python3 rem.py
```

### Typescript client library

To install the REM API Typescript package, run:

```sh
npm install @rewiringamerica/rem
```

Update `INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` and `INSERT_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE` with your own values. If needed, you can sign up for an API key [here](https://rewiring.link/api-signup).

Then, to execute the example script, `rem.ts`, run:

```sh
tsx rem.ts
```
