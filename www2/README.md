# More Complete WWW Demo (HTML/JavaScript)

This demo extends the heat pump demo from [www](../www) with HTML that shows both the 20%
and 80% savings numbers and the average. It also adds better error handling.

The files are:

- [`index-old.html`](./index-old.html): A wireframe web site as it might have existed before
  the REM API was integrated.
- [`index.html`](./index.html): The main HTML file with a form and embedded JavaScript to
  make the API call and display the results.
- [`css/demo.css'](./css/demo.css): A CSS file that provides the wireframe look and feel for the
  demo HTML pages.
